/**
 * Four-square hit burst adapted from RPE Recorder's particle pass.
 *
 * Recorder settings `low_sq`, `high_sq`, `sq_size`, and `sq_time` define the
 * burst: four squares pick a random direction, start with a small random radial
 * offset, travel outward with a quadratic ease-out, and fade linearly while the
 * size follows Recorder's two-phase curve. This module keeps that structure and
 * applies three preview-only tweaks: 12% shorter travel, ±8% square-size
 * jitter, and a 520 ms lifetime instead of 500 ms.
 *
 * Geometry only: no canvas, no DOM. `previewHitEffects` owns the drawing.

/**
 * Owns the host facade assembled from the owning registries and editor services.
 *
 * Internal features register through those owners. Packaged Extensions receive
 * a capability-gated view through `context.api`; the full facade is installed
 * as `window.redux` only by the development server, debug builds, and attached
 * automation. This module is the compatibility boundary for that surface.
 *
 * Minimal browser usage:
 * ```js
 * window.redux.values.byId.get("editor.rate");
 * window.redux.playback.seek(12);
 * console.log(window.redux.playback.state().value);
 * ```
 *
 * Adding a handle is an API compatibility decision: an additive change keeps
 * the application version, while a change to an existing shape or meaning is a
 * breaking change and raises the application MAJOR version.

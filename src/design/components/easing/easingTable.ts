/**
 * The three-box easing editor: id, family, and direction.
 *
 * RPE stores easing as one of 29 numbered curves, and the numbers are not a
 * formula — each family contributes an `In`, an `Out` and sometimes an `InOut`.
 * Editing that number directly is how the chart format works, so the id stays
 * the source of truth, and the two lists are a second view of the same value:
 * choosing a family or a direction rewrites the id, and typing an id selects the
 * family and direction it belongs to.
 *
 * An id outside 1..29 is refused, not clamped: clamping would silently rewrite
 * what the author typed, so the box turns invalid and the chart keeps its value.
